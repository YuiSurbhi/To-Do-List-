# üìù To-Do List Application

This is a simple To-Do List application built using Python's Tkinter library. It allows users to add, display, and delete tasks. The tasks are saved to a file (`tasklist.txt`) to reload them when the application is reopened.

## Features

- **Add Tasks**: Easily add tasks using the input field and the "ADD" button.
- **Display Tasks**: View all your tasks in a scrollable list.
- **Delete Tasks**: Remove tasks by selecting them from the list and clicking the delete button.
- **Persistent Storage**: Tasks are saved in a file (`tasklist.txt`) to ensure they persist between sessions.

## üì¶ Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Tkinter (comes pre-installed with Python)
